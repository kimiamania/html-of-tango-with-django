Fun with Forms
==============
So far we have only presented data through the views and templates that we have created. In this chapter, we will run through how to capture data through web forms. Django comes with some neat form handling functionality, making it a pretty straightforward process to gather information from users and send it back to your web application. According to `Django's documentation on forms <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/forms/>`_, the form handling functionality allows you to:

#. display an HTML form with automatically generated *form widgets* (like a text field or date picker);
#. check submitted data against a set of validation rules;
#. redisplay a form in case of validation errors; and
#. convert submitted form data to the relevant Python data types.

One of the major advantages of using Django's forms functionality is that it can save you a lot of time and HTML hassle.  This part of the tutorial will look at how to implement the necessary infrastructure that will allow users of Rango to add categories and pages to the database via forms.

Basic Workflow
--------------
The basic steps involved in creating a form and allowing users to enter data via the form is as follows.

#. If you haven't already got one, create a ``forms.py`` file within your Django application's directory to store form-related classes.
#. Create a ``ModelForm`` class for each model that you wish to represent as a form.
#. Customise the forms as you desire.
#. Create or update a view to handle the form - including *displaying* the form, *saving* the form data, and *flagging up errors* which may occur when the user enters incorrect data (or no data at all) in the form.
#. Create or update a template to display the form.
#. Add a ``urlpattern`` to map to the new view (if you created a new one).

This workflow is a bit more complicated than previous workflows, and the views that we have to construct have a lot more complexity as well. However, once you undertake the process a few times it will be pretty clear how everything pieces together.

Page and Category Forms
-----------------------
First, create a file called ``forms.py`` within the ``rango`` application directory. While this step is not absolutely necessary, as you could put the forms in the ``models.py``, this makes the codebase a lot cleaner and clearer to understand.

Creating ``ModelForm`` Classes
..............................
Within Rango's ``forms.py`` module, we will be creating a number of classes that inherit from Django's ``ModelForm``. In essence, `a ModelForm <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/forms/modelforms/#modelform>`_ is a *helper class* that allows you to create a Django ``Form`` from a pre-existing model. As we've already got two models defined for Rango (``Category`` and ``Page``), we'll create ``ModelForms`` for both. 

In ``rango/forms.py`` add the following code.

.. code-block:: python
	
	from django import forms
	from rango.models import Page, Category
	
	class CategoryForm(forms.ModelForm):
	    name = forms.CharField(max_length=128, help_text="Please enter the category name.")
	    views = forms.IntegerField(widget=forms.HiddenInput(), initial=0)
	    likes = forms.IntegerField(widget=forms.HiddenInput(), initial=0)
	    
	    # An inline class to provide additional information on the form.
	    class Meta:
	        # Provide an association between the ModelForm and a model
	        model = Category
	
	class PageForm(forms.ModelForm):
	    title = forms.CharField(max_length=128, help_text="Please enter the title of the page.")
	    url = forms.URLField(max_length=200, help_text="Please enter the URL of the page.")
	    views = forms.IntegerField(widget=forms.HiddenInput(), initial=0)
	    
	    class Meta:
	        # Provide an association between the ModelForm and a model
	        model = Page
	        
	        # What fields do we want to include in our form?
	        # This way we don't need every field in the model present.
	        # Some fields may allow NULL values, so we may not want to include them...
	        # Here, we are hiding the foreign key.
	        fields = ('title', 'url','views')

Django provides us with a number of ways to customise the forms that are created on our behalf. In the code sample above, we've specified the widgets that we wish to use for each field to be displayed. For example, in our ``PageForm`` class, we've defined ``forms.CharField`` for the ``title`` field, and ``forms.URLField`` for ``url`` field. Both fields provide text entry for users. Note the ``max_length`` parameters we supply to our fields - the lengths that we specify are identical to the maximum length of each field we specified in the underlying data models. Go back to Chapter :ref:`model-label` to check for yourself, or have a look at Rango's ``models.py`` file.

You will also notice that we have included several ``IntegerField`` entries for the views and likes fields in each form. Note that we have set the widget to be hidden with the parameter setting ``widget=forms.HiddenInput()``, and then set the value to zero with ``initial=0``. This is one way to set the field to zero without giving the control to the user as the field will be hidden, yet the form will provide the value to the model. However, as you can see in the ``PageForm``, despite the fact that we have a hidden field, we still need to include the field in the form. If in ``fields`` we excluded ``views``, then the form would not contain that field (despite it being specified) and so the form would not return the value zero for that field. This may raise an error depending on how the model has been set up. If in the models we specified that the ``default=0`` for these fields then we can rely on the model to automatically populate field with the default value - and thus avoid a ``not null`` error. In this case, it would not be necessary to have these hidden fields. Essentially, you need to be careful when you define your models and forms to make sure that form is going to contain and pass on all the data that is required to populate your model correctly.

Besides the ``CharField`` and ``IntegerField`` widget, many more are available for use. As an example, Django provides ``IntegerField`` (integer entry), ``ChoiceField`` (radio input buttons), and ``DateField`` (for date/time entry). There are many other field types you can use, which perform error checking for you (e.g. *is the value provided a valid integer?*). We highly recommend you have a look at the `official Django documentation on widgets <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/forms/widgets/>`_ to see what components exist and the arguments you can provide to customise them.

Perhaps the most important aspect of a class inheriting from ``ModelForm`` is the need to define *which model we're wanting to provide a form for.* We take care of this through our nested ``Meta`` class. Set the ``model`` attribute of the nested ``Meta`` class to the model you wish to use. For example, our ``CategoryForm`` class has a reference to the ``Category`` model. This is a crucial step enabling Django to take care of creating a form in the image of the specified model. It will also help in handling flagging up any errors along with saving and displaying the data in the form.

We also use the ``Meta`` class to specify which fields that we wish to include in our form through the ``fields`` tuple. Use a tuple of field names to specify the fields you wish to include.

.. note::  We highly recommend you check out the `official Django documentation on forms <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/forms/>`_ for further information about how to customise them.

Creating an *Add Category* View
...............................
With our ``CategoryForm`` class now defined, we're now ready to create a new view to display the form and handle the posting of form data. To do this, add the following code to ``rango/views.py``.

.. code-block:: python
	
	from rango.forms import CategoryForm
	
	def add_category(request):
	    # Get the context from the request.
	    context = RequestContext(request)
	    
	    # A HTTP POST?
	    if request.method == 'POST':
	        form = CategoryForm(request.POST)
	        
	        # Have we been provided with a valid form?
	        if form.is_valid():
	            # Save the new category to the database.
	            form.save(commit=True)
	            
	            # Now call the index() view.
	            # The user will be shown the homepage.
	            return index(request)
	        else:
	            # The supplied form contained errors - just print them to the terminal.
	            print form.errors
	    else:
	        # If the request was not a POST, display the form to enter details.
	        form = CategoryForm()
	    
	    # Bad form (or form details), no form supplied...
	    # Render the form with error messages (if any).
	    return render_to_response('rango/add_category.html', {'form': form}, context)

The new ``add_category()`` view adds several key pieces of functionality for handling forms. First, we access the context surrounding the HTTP request. This then allows us to determine the type of request being made - whether it be a HTTP ``GET`` or ``POST``. This allows us to handle different requests appropriately - whether we want to show a form (i.e. on ``GET``), or process form data (i.e. on ``POST``) - all from the same URL. The ``add_category()`` view function can handle three different scenarios:

- showing a new, blank form for adding a category;
- saving form data provided by the user to the associated model, and rendering the Rango homepage; and
- if there are errors, redisplay the form with error messages.

.. note:: 
	
	What do we mean by ``GET`` and ``POST``? They are two different types of *HTTP requests*. 

	- A HTTP ``GET`` is used to *request a representation of the specified resource.* In other words, we use a HTTP ``GET`` to retrieve a particular resource, whether it be a webpage, image or other file. 
	- In contrast, a HTTP ``POST`` *submits data from the client's web browser to be processed.* This type of request is used for example when submitting the contents of a HTML form. 
	- Ultimately, a HTTP ``POST`` may end up being programmed to create a new resource (e.g. a new database entry) on the server. This can later be accessed through a HTTP ``GET`` request.

Django's form handling machinery has also been utilised to process the data returned from a user's browser via a HTTP ``POST`` request. It not only handles the saving of form data into the chosen model, but will also automatically generate any error messages for each form field (if any are required). This means that Django will not store any submitted forms with missing information which could potentially cause problems for your database's referential integrity. For example, supplying no value in the category name field will return an error, as the field cannot be blank.

You'll notice from the line in which we call ``render_to_response()`` that we refer to a new template called ``add_category.html`` which will contain the relevant Django template code and HTML for the form and page. 

Creating the *Add Category* Template
....................................
Create the file ``templates/rango/add_category.html``. Within the file, add the following HTML markup and Django template code.

.. code-block:: html
	
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	    <head>
	        <title>Rango</title>
	    </head>
	    
	    <body>
	        <h1>Add a Category</h1>
	        
	        <form id="category_form" method="post" action="/rango/add_category/">
	            
	            {% csrf_token %}
	            {% for hidden in form.hidden_fields %}
	                {{ hidden }}
	            {% endfor %}	
	            
	            {% for field in form.visible_fields %}
	                {{ field.errors }}
	                {{ field.help_text}}
	                {{ field }}
	            {% endfor %}
	            
	            <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Create Category" />
	        </form>
	    
	    </body>
	
	</html>

Now, what does this code do? You can see that within the ``<body>`` of the HTML page that we place a ``<form>`` element. Looking at the attributes for the ``<form>`` element, you can see that all data captured within this form is sent to the URL ``/rango/add_category/`` as a HTTP ``POST`` request (the ``method`` attribute is case insensitive, so you can do ``POST`` or ``post`` - both provide the same functionality). Within the form, we have two for loops - one controlling *hidden* form fields, the other *visible* form fields - with visible fields controlled by the ``fields`` attribute of your ``ModelForm`` ``Meta`` class. These loops produce HTML markup for each form element. For visible form fields, we also add in any errors that may be present with a particular field and help text which can be used to explain to the user what he or she needs to enter.

.. note:: The need for hidden as well as visible form fields is necessitated by the fact that HTTP is a stateless protocol. You can't persist state between different HTTP requests which can make certain parts of web applications difficult to implement. To overcome this limitation, hidden HTML form fields were created which allow web applications to pass important information to a client (which cannot be seen on the rendered page) in a HTML form, only to be sent back to the originating server when the user submits the form. 

You should also take note of the code snippet ``{% csrf_token %}``. This is a *Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token*, which helps to protect and secure the HTTP ``POST`` action that is initiated on the subsequent submission of a form. *The CSRF token is required by the Django framework. If you forget to include a CSRF token in your forms, a user may encounter errors when he or she submits the form.* Check out the `official Django documentation on CSRF tokens <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/contrib/csrf/>`_ for more information about this.

Mapping the *Add Category* View
...............................
Now we need to map the ``add_category()`` view to a URL. In the template we have used the URL ``/rango/add_category/`` in the form's submit attribute. So we will need to follow suit in ``rango/urls.py`` and modify the ``urlpatterns`` as follows.

.. code-block:: python
	
	urlpatterns = patterns('',
	    url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),
	    url(r'^add_category/$', views.add_category, name='add_category'), # NEW MAPPING!
	    url(r'^(?P<category_name_url>\w+)', views.category, name='category'),)

Note the order in which we placed our new URL mapping. Django looks for a matching URL, starting with the first tuple entry. It then moves along the tuple sequentially until a match is found (a HTTP 404 error is raised if no match is found). In our example, the URL ``/add_category/`` is our new URL for adding a category. As such, this must always return the add category form, and should take precedence over the category view mapping, which could match to any string combination. If the URL provided does not match ``/add_category/``, Django then falls back to the category view mapping as a last resort. Take a look at the `official Django documentation on how Django process a request <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/http/urls/#how-django-processes-a-request>`_ for more information.

Modifying the Index Page View
.............................
As a final step let's put a link on the index page so that we can easily add categories. Edit the template ``rango/index.html`` and add the following HTML hyperlink just before the ``</body>`` closing tag.

.. code-block:: html
	
	<a href="/rango/add_category/">Add a New Category</a>

Demo
....
Now let's try it out! Run your Django development server, and navigate to ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/rango/``. Use your new link to jump to the add category page, and try adding a category. Figure :num:`fig-rango-form-steps` shows screenshots of the of the Add Category and Index Pages.

.. _fig-rango-form-steps:

.. figure:: ../images/rango-form-steps.png
	:figclass: align-center
	
	Adding a new category to Rango with our new form. The diagram illustrates the steps involved.

Cleaner Forms
.............
Since we have defined the ``url`` attribute in the ``Page`` model to be a ``URLField``, Django expects to be provided with a fully formed URL. Since it can be cumbersome for users to type in an entire URL like ``http://www.url.com``, we can override the ``clean()`` method implemented in ``ModelForm``. For example, in the ``PageForm`` class, include the following method that checks if ``http://`` is included at the start of a new URL - and if not, prepends ``http://`` to the string.

.. code-block:: python

	class PageForm(forms.ModelForm):

	    ...
	    
	    def clean(self):
	        cleaned_data = self.cleaned_data
	        url = cleaned_data.get('url')
	        
	        if not url.startswith('http://'):
	            url = 'http://' + url
	            
	            cleaned_data['url'] = url
	            return cleaned_data

This trivial example shows how we can clean the data being passed through the form before being stored. This is pretty handy, especially when particular fields need to have default values - or data within the form is missing, and we need to handle such data entry problems.

Exercises
---------
Now that you've worked through the chapter, try these exercises to solidify your knowledge on Django's form functionality.

- What happens when you don't enter in a category name on the add category form?
- What happens when you try to add a category that already exists?
- What happens when you visit a category that does not exist?
- How could you gracefully handle when a user visits a category that does not exist?
- Undertake the `part four of the official Django Tutorial <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial04/>`_ if you have not done so already to reinforce what you have learnt here.

Creating an *Add Pages* View, Template and URL Mapping
.......................................................
A next logical step would be to allow users to add pages to a given category. To do this, repeat the same workflow above for Pages - create a new view (and URL mapping), a new template, the URL mapping and then a link from the category page. To get you started, here's the view logic for you.

.. code-block:: python
	
	from rango.forms import PageForm
	
	def add_page(request, category_name_url):
	    context = RequestContext(request)

	    category_name = decode_url(category_name_url)
	    if request.method == 'POST':
	        form = PageForm(request.POST)
	
	        if form.is_valid():
	            # This time we cannot commit straight away.
	            # Not all fields are automatically populated!
	            page = form.save(commit=False)
	
	            # Retrieve the associated Category object so we can add it.
	            cat = Category.objects.get(name=category_name)
	            page.category = cat
	
	            # Also, create a default value for the number of views.
	            page.views = 0
	            
	            # With this, we can then save our new model instance.
	            page.save()
	            
	            # Now that the page is saved, display the category instead.
	            return category(request, category_name)
	        else:
	            print form.errors
	    else:
	        form = PageForm()

	    return render_to_response( 'rango/add_page.html', 
	            {'category_name_url': category_name_url, 
	             'category_name': category_name, 'form': form},
	             context)

Hints
.....
To help you with the exercises above, the following hints may be of some use to you.

* Update the category view to pass through the ``category_name_url``.
* Update the ``category.html`` with a link to ``/rango/category/<category_name_url>/add_page/``.
* Update ``rango/urls.py`` with a URL mapping to handle the above link.
