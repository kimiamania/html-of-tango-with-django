User Authentication
===================
The aim of this next part of the tutorial is to get you familiar with the user authentication mechanisms provided by Django. We'll by using the ``auth`` application provided as part of a standard Django installation in package ``django.contrib.auth``. According to `Django's official documentation on Authentication <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/auth/>`_, the application consists of the following aspects.

- *Users.*
- *Permissions:* a series of binary flags (e.g. yes/no) determining what a user may or may not do.
- *Groups:* a method of applying permissions to more than one user.
- A configurable *password hashing system:* a must for ensuring data security.
- *Forms and view tools for logging in users,* or restricting content.
- A *pluggable backend system,* allowing you to provide your own authentication-related functionality.

There's lots that Django can do for you in the area of user authentication. We'll be covering the basics to get you started. This'll help you build your confidence with the available tools and their underlying concepts.

Setting up Authentication
-------------------------
Before you can begin to play around with Django's authentication offering, you'll need to make sure that the relevant settings are present in your Rango project's ``settings.py`` file.

Within the ``settings.py`` file find the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` tuple and check that ``django.contrib.auth`` and ``django.contrib.contenttypes`` are listed, so that it looks like the code below:

.. code-block:: python
	
	INSTALLED_APPS = (
	    'django.contrib.auth', # THIS LINE SHOULD BE PRESENT AND UNCOMMENTED
	    'django.contrib.contenttypes', # THIS LINE SHOULD BE PRESENT AND UNCOMMENTED
	    'django.contrib.sessions',
	    'django.contrib.sites',
	    'django.contrib.messages',
	    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
	    # Uncomment the next line to enable the admin:
	    'django.contrib.admin',
	    # Uncomment the next line to enable admin documentation:
	    # 'django.contrib.admindocs',
	    'rango',
	)

While ``django.contrib.auth`` provides Django with access to the authentication system, ``django.contrib.contenttypes`` is used by the authentication application to track models installed in your database. Check out the `Official Django documentation for more details <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/contrib/contenttypes/>`_ on what ``django.contrib.contenttypes`` is and does to make your life easier.

.. note:: Remember, if you had to add either one of the ``auth`` or ``contenttypes`` applications to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` tuple, you will need to resynchronise your database with the ``$ python manage.py syncdb`` command.

Passwords are stored by default in Django using the `PBKDF2 algorithm <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2>`_, providing a good level of security for your user's data. You can read more about this as part of the `official Django documentation on how django stores passwords  <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/auth/passwords/#how-django-stores-passwords>`_. The documentation also provides an explanation of how to use different password hashers if you require a greater level of security. 

The ``User`` Model
------------------
The core of Django's authentication system is the ``User`` object, located at ``django.contrib.auth.models.User``. A ``User`` object represents each of the people interacting with a Django application. The `Django documentation on User objects <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/auth/default/#user-objects>`_ states that they are used to allow aspects of the authentication system like access restriction, registration of new user profiles and the association of creators with site content.

The ``User`` model comes complete with five primary attributes. They are:

- the username for the user account;
- the account's password;
- the user's email address;
- the user's first name; and
- the user's surname.

The model also comes with other attributes such as ``is_active`` (which determines whether a particular account is active or not). Check the `official Django documentation on the user model <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/contrib/auth/#django.contrib.auth.models.User>`_ for a full list of attributes provided by the base ``User`` model.

Additional User Attributes
--------------------------
However, what if all the provided attributes that the ``User`` model provides isn't enough? For our Rango application, we want to include two more additional attributes for each user account. Specifically, we wish to include:

- a ``URLField``, allowing a user of Rango to specify their own website; and
- a ``ImageField``, which allows users to specify a picture for their user profile.

Fortunately, this is a relatively easy task to accomplish. This is achieved through the creation of an additional model in Rango's ``models.py`` file. Let's add the new model - add the following code.

.. code-block:: python
	
	class UserProfile(models.Model):
	    # This line is required. Links UserProfile to a User model instance.
	    user = models.OneToOneField(User)
	    
	    # The additional attributes we wish to include.
	    website = models.URLField(blank=True)
	    picture = models.ImageField(upload_to='profile_images', blank=True)
	    
	    # Override the __unicode__() method to return out something meaningful!
	    def __unicode__(self):
	        return self.user.username

As we also reference the ``User`` model, we'll need to include the model into the ``models.py`` namespace. Add it with the following import statement at the top of the file.

.. code-block:: python
	
	from django.contrib.auth.models import User

So, how do we accomplish our goal of adding additional user profile fields? This isn't achieved through inheritance, instead the ``UserProfile`` model inherits from Django's ``Model`` class and is linked to the base ``User`` class through a one-to-one relationship via attribute ``user``. This is because various applications may all want to use the User model and extend upon it in different ways.

For Rango, we've added two fields to complete our user profile, and provided a ``__unicode__()`` method to return a meaningful value when a unicode representation of a ``UserProfile`` model instance is requested.

For the two fields ``website`` and ``picture``, we have set ``blank=True`` for both. This allows each of the fields to be blank if necessary, meaning that users need not supply values for the attributes if they do not wish to.

Note that the ``ImageField`` field has an ``upload_to`` attribute. The value of this attribute is conjoined with the project's ``MEDIA_ROOT`` setting to provide a path with which uploaded profile images will be stored. For example, a ``MEDIA_ROOT`` of ``<workspace>/tango_with_django_project/media/`` and ``upload_to`` attribute of ``profile_images`` will result in all profile images being stored in the directory ``<workspace>/tango_with_django_project/media/profile_images/``.

.. warning:: The Django ``ImageField`` field makes use of the *Python Imaging Library (PIL).* Back in Chapter :ref:`requirements-label`, we discussed installing PIL along with Django to your setup. If you haven't got PIL installed, you'll need to install it now. If you don't, you'll be greeted with exceptions stating that the module ``pil`` cannot be found!

With our ``UserProfile`` model defined, we now edit Rango's ``admin.py`` file to include the new ``UserProfile`` model in the Django administration web interface. In the ``admin.py`` file, add the following line.

.. code-block:: python
	
	admin.site.register(UserProfile)

You also need to import the ``UserProfile`` model by adding one of the following lines at the top of the ``admin.py`` file. Choose which one you like - the first imports ``UserProfile`` with a separate import statement, while the second combines the import of ``UserProfile`` with Rango models that we have used previously in ``admin.py``.

.. code-block:: python
	
	# Import the UserProfile model individually.
	from rango.models import UserProfile
	
	# Import the UserProfile model with Category and Page.
	# If you choose this option, you'll want to modify the import statement you've already got to include UserProfile.
	from rango.models import Category, Page, UserProfile

.. note:: Remember that your database must be synchronised with the creation of a new model. Run ``$ python manage.py syncdb`` from your terminal to synchronise the new ``UserProfile`` model. This process involves Django creating one or more underlying database tables for the given model. Forgetting to synchronise your changes will result in errors explaining that the required database tables cannot be found.

Creating a *User Registration* View and Template
------------------------------------------------
With our authentication infrastructure laid out, we can now begin to build onto it by providing users of our application with the opportunity to create new user accounts. We will achieve this via the creation of a new view and template combination.

.. note:: We feel it's important to note that there are several off-the-shelf user registration packages available for you to download and use in your Django projects. Examples include the `Django Registration application <https://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/>`_, and you can also check out the table on `this webpage <https://www.djangopackages.com/grids/g/registration/>`_ which lists other registration packages. While these exist, we'll be showing you how to set up everything from scratch. While this is at odds with the DRY principle, it is also important to get a feeling for the user authentication package and feature. It will also re-enforce your understanding of working with forms, how to extend upon the user model, and how to upload media.

To set everything the user registration functionality will we go through the following steps:

#. Create a ``UserForm`` and ``UserProfileForm``.
#. Add a view to handle the creation of a new user.
#. Create a  template that displays the ``UserForm`` and ``UserProfileForm``.
#. Map a URL to the view created.
#. Link the index page to the register page


.. _login-formclasses-label:

Creating the ``UserForm`` and ``UserProfileForm``
.................................................
In ``rango/forms.py``, we now need to create two classes inheriting from ``forms.ModelForm``. We'll be creating one for the base ``User`` class, as well as one for the new ``UserProfile`` model that we just created. The two ``ModelForm`` inheriting classes allow us to display a HTML form displaying the necessary form fields for a particular model, taking away a significant amount of work for us. Neat!

In ``rango/forms.py``, let's create our two classes which inherit from ``forms.ModelForm``. Add the following code to the module.

.. code-block:: python
	
	class UserForm(forms.ModelForm):
	    password = forms.CharField(widget=forms.PasswordInput())
	    
	    class Meta:
	        model = User
	        fields = ('username', 'email', 'password')

	class UserProfileForm(forms.ModelForm):
	    class Meta:
	        model = UserProfile
	        fields = ('website', 'picture')

You'll notice that within both classes we create, we add a `nested <http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus7/html/page598.html>`_ ``Meta`` class. As `the name of the nested class may suggest <http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/M/meta.html>`_, anything within a nested ``Meta`` class describes additional properties about the particular ``ModelForm`` class it belongs to. Each ``Meta`` class must at a bare minimum supply a ``model`` field, which references back to the model the ``ModelForm`` inheriting class should relate to. Our ``UserForm`` class is therefore associated with the ``User`` model, for example. By default, Django then renders a HTML form for *all* fields within the associated model.

However, there may be scenarios where we would not want a user to provide information for *all* fields within the associated model. For example, certain form fields may need to be filled in automatically by your code - such as in the ``UserProfileForm``. Recall that the ``UserProfile`` model contains a ``user`` attribute, providing a one-to-one relationship to the ``User`` model. We don't want users to see this abstraction - we want Rango to handle it for them! With the ``fields`` attribute, we can fine tune what fields the user sees in a rendered form. ``UserProfileForm`` will therefore display entries for the ``website`` and ``picture`` fields, but will not provide anything for the ``user`` field.

You'll also notice that ``UserForm`` includes a definition of the ``password`` attribute. While a ``User`` model instance contains a ``password`` attribute by default, the rendered HTML form element is of the incorrect type. If a user types a password, the password will be visible. By updating the ``password`` attribute definition, we can then specify that the ``CharField`` instance should hide a user's input from prying eyes through use of the ``PasswordInput()`` widget.

You shouldn't forget to include the required classes at the top of the ``forms.py`` module!

.. code-block:: python
	
	from rango.models import UserProfile
	from django.contrib.auth.models import User


Creating the ``register()`` View
................................
Next we need to handle both the rendering of the form, and the processing of form input data. Within Rango's ``views.py`` file, add the following view function:

.. code-block:: python
	
	from rango.forms import UserForm, UserProfileForm
	
	def register(request):
	    # Like before, get the request's context.
	    context = RequestContext(request)
	    
	    # A boolean value for telling the template whether the registration was successful.
	    # Set to False initially. Code changes value to True when registration succeeds.
	    registered = False
	    
	    # If it's a HTTP POST, we're interested in processing form data.
	    if request.method == 'POST':
	        # Attempt to grab information from the raw form information.
	        # Note that we make use of both UserForm and UserProfileForm.
	        user_form = UserForm(data=request.POST)
	        profile_form = UserProfileForm(data=request.POST)
	        
	        # If the two forms are valid...
	        if user_form.is_valid() and profile_form.is_valid():
	            # Save the user's form data to the database.
	            user = user_form.save()
	            
	            # Now we hash the password with the set_password method.
	            # Once hashed, we can update the user object.
	            user.set_password(user.password)
	            user.save()
	            
	            # Now sort out the UserProfile instance.
	            # Since we need to set the user attribute ourselves, we set commit=False.
	            # This delays saving the model until we're ready to avoid integrity problems.
	            profile = profile_form.save(commit=False)
	            profile.user = user
	            
	            # Did the user provide a profile picture?
	            # If so, we need to get it from the input form and put it in the UserProfile model.
	            if 'picture' in request.FILES:
	                profile.picture = request.FILES['picture']
	            
	            # Now we save the UserProfile model instance.
	            profile.save()
	            
	            # Update our variable to tell the template registration was successful.
	            registered = True
	        
	        # Invalid form or forms - mistakes or something else?
	        # Print problems to the terminal.
	        # They'll also be shown to the user.
	        else:
	            print user_form.errors, profile_form.errors
	    
	    # Not a HTTP POST, so we render our form using two ModelForm instances.
	    # These forms will be blank, ready for user input.
	    else:
	        user_form = UserForm()
	        profile_form = UserProfileForm()
	    
	    # Render the template depending on the context.
	    return render_to_response(
	            'rango/register.html',
	            {'user_form': user_form, 'profile_form': profile_form, 'registered': registered},
	            context)

Is the view a lot more complex? It might look so at first, but it isn't really. The only added complexity from our previous ``add_category()`` view is the need to handle two distinct ``ModelForm`` instances - one for the ``User`` model, and one for the ``UserProfile`` model. We also need to handle a user's profile image, if he or she chooses to upload one.

We also establish a link between the two model instances that we create. After creating a new ``User`` model instance, we reference it in the ``UserProfile`` instance with the line ``profile.user = user``. This is where we populate the ``user`` attribute of the ``UserProfileForm`` form, which we hid from users in Section :ref:`login-formclasses-label`.


Creating the *Registration* Template
....................................
Now create a new template file, ``rango/register.html`` and add the following code:

.. code-block:: html
	
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	    <head>
	        <title>Rango</title>
	    </head>

	    <body>
	        <h1>Register with Rango</h1>

	        {% if registered %}
	        Rango says: <strong>thank you for registering!</strong>
	        <a href="/rango/">Return to the homepage.</a><br />
	        {% else %}
	        Rango says: <strong>register here!</strong><br />

	        <form id="user_form" method="post" action="/rango/register/"
	                enctype="multipart/form-data">

	            {% csrf_token %}
	            
	            <!-- Display each form. The as.p method wraps each element in a paragraph
	                 (<p>) element. This ensures each element appears on a new line,
	                 making everything look neater. -->
	            {{ user_form.as_p }}
	            {{ profile_form.as_p }}
	            
	            <!-- Provide a button to click to submit the form. -->
	            <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Register" />
	        </form>
	        {% endif %}
	    </body>
	</html>

This HTML template makes use of the ``register`` variable we used in our view indicating whether registration was successful or not. Note that ``registered`` must be ``False`` in order for the template to display the registration form - otherwise, apart from the title, only a success message is displayed.

.. warning::  
	You should be aware of the ``enctype`` attribute for the ``<form>`` element. When you want users to upload files from a form, it's an absolute *must* to set ``enctype`` to ``multipart/form-data``. This attribute and value combination instructs your browser to send form data in a special way back to the server. Essentially, the data representing your file is split into a series of chunks and sent. For more information, check out `this great Stack Overflow answer <http://stackoverflow.com/a/4526286>`_. You should also should remember to include the CSRF token, too. Ensure that you include ``{% csrf_token %}`` within your ``<form>`` element.

The ``register()`` View URL Mapping
...................................
Now we can add a URL mapping to our new view. In ``rango/urls.py`` modify the ``urlpatterns`` tuple as shown below:

.. code-block:: python
	
	urlpatterns = patterns('',
	    url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),
	    url(r'^about/$', views.about, name='about'),
	    url(r'^category/(?P<category_name_url>\w+)$', views.category, name='category'),
	    url(r'^add_category/$', views.add_category, name='add_category'),
	    url(r'^category/(?P<category_name_url>\w+)/add_page/$', views.add_page, name='add_page'),
	    url(r'^register/$', views.register, name='register'), # ADD NEW PATTERN!
	    )

The newly added pattern points the URL ``/rango/register/`` to the ``register()`` view. 

Linking Together
................
Finally, we can add a link pointing to that URL in our homepage ``index.html`` template. Underneath the link to the category addition page, add the following hyperlink.

.. code-block:: html
	
	<a href="/rango/register/">Register Here</a>

Demo
....
Easy! Now you'll have a new hyperlink with the text ``Register Here`` that'll take you to the registration page. Try it out now! Start your Django development server and try to register a new user account. Upload a profile image if you wish. Your registration form should look like the one illustrated in Figure :num:`fig-rango-register-form`.

.. _fig-rango-register-form:

.. figure:: ../images/rango-register-form.png
	:figclass: align-center

	A screenshot illustrating the basic registration form you create as part of this tutorial.

Upon seeing the message indicating your details were successfully registered, the database should have two new entries in its tables corresponding to the ``User`` and ``UserProfile`` models. 

Adding Login Functionality
--------------------------
With the ability to register accounts completed, we now need to add login in functionality. To achieve this we will need to undertake the workflow below:

* Create a login in view to handle user credentials
* Create a login template to display the login form
* Map the login view to a url
* Provide a link to login from the index page

Creating the ``login()`` View
.............................
In ``rango/views.py`` create a new function called ``user_login()`` and add the following code:

.. code-block:: python
	
	def user_login(request):
	    # Like before, obtain the context for the user's request.
	    context = RequestContext(request)
	    
	    # If the request is a HTTP POST, try to pull out the relevant information.
	    if request.method == 'POST':
	        # Gather the username and password provided by the user.
	        # This information is obtained from the login form.
	        username = request.POST['username']
	        password = request.POST['password']
	        
	        # Use Django's machinery to attempt to see if the username/password
	        # combination is valid - a User object is returned if it is.
	        user = authenticate(username=username, password=password)
	        
	        # If we have a User object, the details are correct.
	        # If None (Python's way of representing the absence of a value), no user
	        # with matching credentials was found.
	        if user is not None:
	            # Is the account active? It could have been disabled.
	            if user.is_active:
	                # If the account is valid and active, we can log the user in.
	                # We'll send the user back to the homepage.
	                login(request, user)
	                return HttpResponseRedirect('/rango/')
	            else:
	                # An inactive account was used - no logging in!
	                return HttpResponse("Your Rango account is disabled.")
	        else:
	            # Bad login details were provided. So we can't log the user in.
	            print "Invalid login details: {0}, {1}".format(username, password)
	            return HttpResponse("Invalid login details supplied.")
	    
	    # The request is not a HTTP POST, so display the login form.
	    # This scenario would most likely be a HTTP GET.
	    else:
	        # No context variables to pass to the template system, hence the
	        # blank dictionary object...
	        return render_to_response('rango/login.html', {}, context)

This view may seem rather complicated as it has to handle a variety of situations. Like in previous examples before, the ``user_login()`` view handles form rendering and processing. 

First, if the view is accessed via the HTTP GET method, then the login form is displayed. However, if the form has been posted via the HTTP POST method, then we can handle processing the form.

If a valid form is sent, the username and password are extracted from the form. These details are then used to attempt to authenticate the user (with Django's ``authenticate()`` function). ``authenticate()`` then returns a ``User`` object if the username/password combination exists within the database - or ``None`` if no match was found. 

If we retrieve a ``User`` object, we can then check if the account is active or inactive - and return the appropriate response to the client's browser.

However, if an invalid form is sent, because the user did not add both a username and password the login form is presented back to the user will form error messages (i.e. username/password is missing).

Of particular interest in the code sample above is the use of the built-in Django machinery to help with the authentication process. Note the use of the ``authenticate()`` function to check whether the username and password provided match to a valid user account, and the ``login()`` function to signify to Django that the user is to be logged in. 

You'll also notice that we make use of a new class, ``HttpResponseRedirect``. As the name may suggest to you, the response generated by an instance of the ``HttpResponseRedirect`` class tells the client's browser to redirect to the URL you provide as the argument. Note that this will return a HTTP status code of 302, which denotes a redirect, as opposed to an status code of 200 i.e. OK. See the `official Django documentation  on Redirection <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpResponseRedirect>`_, to learn more.

All of these functions and classes are provided by Django, and as such you'll need to import them, so add the following imports to ``rango/views.py``:

.. code-block:: python
	
	from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login
	from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect

Creating a *Login* Template
...........................
With our new view created, we'll need to create a new template allowing users to login. While we know that the template will live in the ``templates/rango/`` directory, we'll leave you to figure out the name of the file. Look at the code example above to work out the name. In your new template file, add the following code:

.. code-block:: html
	
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	    <head>
	        <!-- Is anyone getting tired of repeatedly entering the header over and over?? -->
	        <title>Rango</title>
	    </head>

	    <body>
	        <h1>Login to Rango</h1>

	        <form id="login_form" method="post" action="/rango/login/">
	            {% csrf_token %}
	            Username: <input type="text" name="username" value="" size="50" />
	            <br />
	            Password: <input type="password" name="password" value="" size="50" />
	            <br />

	            <input type="submit" value="submit" />
	        </form>

	    </body>
	</html>

Ensure that you match up the input ``name`` attributes to those that you specified in the ``user_login()`` view - i.e. ``username`` for the username, and ``password`` for password. Don't forget the ``{% csrf_token %}``, either!

Mapping the Login View to a URL
...............................
With your login template created, we can now match up the ``user_login()`` view to a URL. Modify Rango's ``urls.py`` file so that its ``urlpatterns`` tuple now looks like the code below:

.. code-block:: python
	
	urlpatterns = patterns('',
	    url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),
	    url(r'^about/$', views.about, name='about'),
	    url(r'^category/(?P<category_name_url>\w+)$', views.category, name='category'),
	    url(r'^add_category/$', views.add_category, name='add_category'),
	    url(r'^category/(?P<category_name_url>\w+)/add_page/$', views.add_page, name='add_page'),
	    url(r'^register/$', views.register, name='register'),
	    url(r'^login/$', views.user_login, name='login'),
	    )

Linking Together
................
Our final step is to provide users of Rango with a handy link to access the login page. To do this, we'll edit the ``index.html`` template inside of the ``templates/rango/`` directory. Find the previously created category addition and registration links, and add the following hyperlink underneath. You may wish to include a line break (``<br />``) before the link.

.. code-block:: python
	
	<a href="/rango/login/">Login</a>

If you like, you can also modify the header of the index page to provide a personalised message if a user is logged in, and a more generic message if the user isn't. Within the ``index.html`` template, find the header, as shown in the code snippet below.

.. code-block:: python
	
	<h1>Rango says..hello world!</h1>

Replace this header with the following markup and Django template code. Note that we make use of the ``user`` object, which is available to Django's template system via the context. We can tell from this object if the user is logged in (authenticated). If he or she is logged in, we can also obtain details about him or her.

.. code-block:: python
	
	{% if user.is_authenticated %}
	<h1>Rango says... hello {{ user.username }}!</h1>
	{% else %}
	<h1>Rango says... hello world!</h1>
	{% endif %}

As you can see we have used  Django's Template Language to check if the user is authenticated with ``{% if user.is_authenticated %}``. The context variable which we pass through to the template will include a user variable if the user is logged in - so we can check whether they are authenticated or not. If so they will receive a personalised greeting in the header, i.e. ``Rango says... hello leifos!``. Otherwise, the generic ``Rango says... hello world!`` header is displayed.

With this completed, user logins should now be completed! To test everything out, try starting Django's development server and attempt to register a new account. After successful registration, you should then be able to login with the details you just provided.

Restricting Access
------------------
Now that users can login to Rango, we can now go about restricting access to particular parts of the application as per the specification, i.e. that only registered users can add categories and pages. With Django, there are two ways in which we can achieve this goal:

* directly, by examining the ``request`` object and check if the user is authenticated, or,
* using a convenience *decorator* function that check if the user is authenticated.

The direct approach checks to see whether a user is logged in, via the ``user.is_authenticated()`` method. The ``user`` object is available via the ``request`` object passed into a view. The following example demonstrates this approach.

.. code-block:: python
	
	def some_view(request):
	    if not request.user.is_authenticated():
	        return HttpResponse("You are logged in.")
	    else:
	        return HttpResponse("You are not logged in.")

The second approach uses `Python decorators <http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecorators>`_. Decorators are named after a `software design pattern by the same name <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern>`_. They can dynamically alter the functionality of a function, method or class without having to directly edit the source code of the given function, method or class.

Django provides decorator called, ``login_required()`` which we can attach to any view, where we require the user to be logged in. If a user is not logged in and they try to access a page which calls that view, then the user is redirected to another page which you can set, typically the login page.

Restricting Access with a Decorator
...................................
To try this out,  create a view in Rango's ``views.py`` file, called ``restricted()`` and add the following code:

.. code-block:: python
	
	@login_required
	def restricted(request):
	    return HttpResponse("Since you're logged in, you can see this text!")

Note that to use a decorator, you place it *directly above* the function signature, and put a ``@`` before naming the decorator. Python will execute the decorator before executing the code of your function/method. To use the decorator you will have to import it, so also add the following import:

.. code-block:: python
	
	from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

We'll also add in another pattern to Rango's ``urlpatterns`` tuple in the ``urls.py`` file. Our tuple should then look something like the following example. Note the inclusion of mapping of the ``views.restricted`` view - this is the mapping you need to add.

.. code-block:: python
	
	urlpatterns = patterns('',
	    url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),
	    url(r'^add_category/$', views.add_category, name='add_category'),
	    url(r'^register/$', views.register, name='register'),
	    url(r'^login/$', views.user_login, name='login'),
	    url(r'^restricted/', views.restricted, name='restricted'),
	    url(r'^(?P<category_name_url>\w+)', views.category, name='category'),)

We'll also need to handle the scenario where a user attempts to access the ``restricted()`` view, but is not logged in. What do we do with the user? The simplest approach is to redirect his or her browser. Django allows us to specify this in our project's ``settings.py`` file, located in the project configuration directory. In ``settings.py``, define the variable ``LOGIN_URL`` with the URL you'd like to redirect users to that aren't logged in, i.e. the login page located at ``/rango/login/``:

.. code-block:: python
	
	LOGIN_URL = '/rango/login/'

This ensures that the ``login_required()`` decorator will redirect any user not logged in to the URL ``/rango/login/``. 

Logging Out
-----------
To enable users to log out gracefully it would be nice to provide a logout option to users. Django comes with a handy ``logout()`` function that take cares of ensuring that the user is logged out, that their session is ended, and that if they subsequent try to access a view, that it will deny them access.

To provide log out functionality in ``rango/views.py`` add the a view called ``user_logout()`` with the following code:

.. code-block:: python
	
	from django.contrib.auth import logout
	
	# Use the login_required() decorator to ensure only those logged in can access the view.
	@login_required
	def user_logout(request):
	    # Since we know the user is logged in, we can now just log them out.
	    logout(request)
	    
	    # Take the user back to the homepage.
	    return HttpResponseRedirect('/rango/')

.. note:: Where's ``RequestContext()``? In this simple user logout view, there's no need to obtain the request's context from Django's backend. If we don't need it, why ask for it?

With the view created, map the URL ``/rango/logout/`` to the ``user_logout()`` view by modifying the ``urlpatterns`` tuple in Rango's ``urls.py`` module:

.. code-block:: python
	
	urlpatterns = patterns('',
	    url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),
	    url(r'^about/$', views.about, name='about'),
	    url(r'^category/(?P<category_name_url>\w+)$', views.category, name='category'),
	    url(r'^add_category/$', views.add_category, name='add_category'),
	    url(r'^category/(?P<category_name_url>\w+)/add_page/$', views.add_page, name='add_page'),
	    url(r'^register/$', views.register, name='register'),
	    url(r'^login/$', views.user_login, name='login'),
	    url(r'^restricted/$', views.restricted, name='restricted'),
	    url(r'^logout/$', views.user_logout, name='logout'),
	    )

Now that all the machinery for logging a user out has been completed, it'd be handy to provide a link from the homepage to allow users to simply click a link to logout. However, let's be smart about this: is there any point providing the logout link to a user who isn't logged in? Perhaps not - it may be more beneficial for a user who isn't logged in to be given the chance to register, for example.

Like in the previous section, we'll be modifying Rango's ``index.html`` template, and making use of the ``user`` object in the template's context to determine what links we want to show. Find your growing list of links at the bottom of the page and replace it with the following HTML markup and Django template code. Note we also add a link to our restricted page at ``/rango/restricted/``.

.. code-block:: html
	
	{% if user.is_authenticated %}
	<a href="/rango/restricted/">Restricted Page</a><br />
	<a href="/rango/logout/">Logout</a><br />
	{% else %}
	<a href="/rango/register/">Register Here</a><br />
	<a href="/rango/login/">Login</a><br />
	{% endif %}
	
	<a href="/rango/about/">About</a><br/>
	<a href="/rango/add_category/">Add a New Category</a><br />

Simple - when a user is authenticated and logged in, he or she can see the ``Restricted Page`` and ``Logout`` links. If he or she isn't logged in, ``Register Here`` and ``Login`` are presented. As ``About`` and ``Add a New Category`` are not within the template conditional blocks, these links are available to both anonymous and logged in users.

Exercises
---------
This chapter has covered several important aspects of managing user authentication within Django. We've covered the basics of installing Django's ``django.contrib.auth`` application into our project. Additionally, we have also shown how to implement a user profile model that can provide additional fields to the base ``django.contrib.auth.models.User`` model. We have also detailed how to setup the functionality to allow user registrations, login, logout, and to control access. For more information about user authentication and registration consult  `Django's official documentation on Authentication <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/auth/>`_.

* Customise the application so that only registered users can add/edit, while non-registered can only view/use the categories/pages. You'll also have ensure links to add/edit pages appear only if the user browsing the website is logged in.
* Provide informative error messages when users incorrectly enter their username or password.
	
In most applications you are going to require different levels of security when registering and managing users - for example, making sure the user enters an email address that they have access to, or sending users passwords that they have forgotten. While we could extend the current approach and build all the necessary infrastructure to support such functionality a ``django-registration`` application has been developed which greatly simplifies the process - visit https://django-registration.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ to find out more about using this package.
